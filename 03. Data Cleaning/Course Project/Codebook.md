# About the Dataset
A study involving 30 volunteers (aged 19-48) investigated various movements using smartphones worn on their waists. Each participant performed six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and lying down.

Smartphones collected sensor data (acceleration and gyroscope) at 50Hz, capturing body movements in three dimensions. To ensure accuracy, the activities were also video-recorded and manually labeled.

For analysis, the data was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Before diving in, the sensor signals were cleaned up with noise filters and segmented into overlapping windows. These windows then underwent further processing to separate gravitational and body motion components, allowing for better feature extraction. Finally, various time and frequency-based features were calculated from each window for further analysis.
# Attribute Information
* **Detailed sensor measurements**: Each record captures multiple aspects of movement through triaxial acceleration (both total and estimated body), triaxial angular velocity, and a comprehensive 561-feature vector spanning time and frequency domains.
* **Action classification**: Records are associated with clear labels indicating the specific activity being performed.
* **Participant identification**: Unique identifiers link each record to the individual who participated in the experiment.
