    "# Getting and Cleaning Data Project\n",
    "Author: Farina Fayyaz\n",

    "# Goal of the Project\n",
    "1. A tidy data set\n",
    "2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis\n",
    "3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.\n",
    "4. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.\n",
    "5. Analysis R Script\n",

    "# To Perform the run_analysis.R file\n",
    "* Check for Tidyverse: Make sure you have the \"tidyverse\" collection of packages installed in your R environment. If you don't, run this command in your R session: install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n",
    "* Clone the Repository: Obtain a copy of the project's repository onto your computer.\n",
    "* Navigate to the Directory: Open R and use the setwd() function to set your working directory to the project's home directory (the main folder where the run_analysis.R script is located).\n",
    "* Run the Script: Execute the following command in your R session to initiate the analysis: source(\"run_analysis.R\")\n",

    "# How it works\n",
    "These are the steps followed in the run_analysis.r script\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the dependence (tidyverse)\n",
    "```\n",
    "library(tidyverse)\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. Retrieve and extract the data. Verify the existence of the data directory; if absent, create it. Download the file and unzip it to \"Data\" directory. \"Data/UCI HAR Dataset\" will contain the requisite files.\n",
    "```\n",

    "3. Read the features.txt file, that contains the names of the variables and store them in a character vector\r",
